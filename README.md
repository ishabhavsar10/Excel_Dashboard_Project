# Excel_Dashboard_Project
The two Excel files, though they focus on different business sectors, are both designed to provide clear and useful insights through data visualization. The "Zomato Dashboard_Project.xlsx" file analyzes restaurant data to help a food business improve its sales, understand customer behavior, and optimize overall performance. On the other hand, the "Manufacturing Dashboard_Isha.xlsx" file looks at manufacturing data, giving a detailed view of production, costs, and quality control to help a manufacturing company run its operations more smoothly. Both dashboards use simple visuals and easy-to-understand layouts to help users make smarter, faster decisions.
